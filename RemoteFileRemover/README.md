# RemoteFileRemover
 - The aim of the script is to first remove files on a given remote host
 - Then remove recursively the directories that contained those files

***Warning!***  
While the script provides some flexibility on the input arguments,  
the situation remains that it was originally created to remove files from a specific remote host,  
so some tunning might be needed for use to other cases.
