# Mean cross-section finder
This script runs ontop of the output files produced by the Powheg + MC rivet routine,  
where MC stands for any MC that can be interfaced with Powheg, like Pythia or Herwig++,  
and derive the average cross section of the hole procedure.  

We need this cross-section calculation in order to scale the output distributions  
to a common ground and therefore be able to perform comparisons between different  
results.
